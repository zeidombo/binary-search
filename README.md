# Binary Search

Binary search problems are specilly tricky because they always have certain cases that might be out of sight.
In this repo I covered all cases possible of a binary search problem. The problem is as usual. You're given N cards sorted in a decreasing order and asked to pick a given card.

## 3 different approches have been used
1. Brute Force or Linear Search
2. Recursion
3. Improved Brute Force solution that covers all possible cases.
This solution is the most potent one as it deals with different scenario you might encounter during search.

To make it easy to grasp I put together a few test cases to test every approch and see how solutions compare to each other regarding complexity.

 Examining all three approches you will see that #3 is the optimal one.
